          <p>
            Until recently, I spent each day as a professional violin player
            immersed in a centuries-old world. I spent thousands of hours with a
            piece of technology built around the year 1800, and with it I
            explored a world of language and ideas stretching back even further.
            I used to joke that my analog brain couldn't function without pencil
            and paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            ...and then one day, I found myself staring at an algorithm written
            in Java, and I realized I was looking at pure poetry. Reading
            well-written code is like listening to Bach- it's magic!
          </p>
          <p>
            The tools of my current trade might be newer, but the journey they
            accompany, through a world of language and ideas, isn't all that
            different...and yes, pencil and paper still have a place for me,
            even in the digital world.
