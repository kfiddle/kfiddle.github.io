        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Until recently, I spent each day as a professional violin player
          immersed in a centuries-old world. I spent thousands of hours with a
          piece of technology built around the year 1800, and with it I explored
          a world of language and ideas stretching back even further. I used to
          joke that my analog brain couldn't function without pencil and paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...and then one day, I found myself staring at an algorithm written in
          Java, and I realized I was looking at pure poetry. Reading
          well-written code is like listening to Bach- it's magic!
        </p>
        <p>
          The tools of my current trade might be newer, but the journey they
          accompany, through a world of language and ideas, isn't all that
          different...and yes, pencil and paper still have a place for me, even
          in the digital world.
